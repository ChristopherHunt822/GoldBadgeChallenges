# GoldBadgeChallenges

Console Apps for Eleven Fifty Academy Gold Badge Challenges - Software Development.

The entire solution was developed in visual studio using C#. The solution consists of three finished console applications and a 4th named badging that was started. The apps all utilized the expected CRUD methods to complete the goals of each challenge.

Installation

Open the GoldBadgeChallenges solution in Microsoft Visual Studio. Each challenge required a class library assembly for the repository, a unit test assembly to test the methods of the repository and a Console App assembly for a user.
